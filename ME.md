- 👋 Hi, I’m @Klackters, that's my nickname, you can call me Breno xD. I'm from Brazil, SP, I love to learn with more experienced people
- 👀 I’m interested in technology at areas no one look at, like quantum computing in aerospace engineering
- 🌱 I’m currently learning System Development and analysis at FATEC - Americana, and I also learn Biomedicine at another university
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that I can help and get experience from, knowledge is always welcome :D
